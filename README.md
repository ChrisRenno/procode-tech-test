# Developer Notes

Not super polished as I wanted to make sure that I had something in place as I hadn't previously set up a redux store, so I made sure I had an app working with useState first in case I ran into issues in the timeframe. 

I did get copilot to assist (heavily) with the refactor to redux - using the chat functionality which is becoming more and more part of my workflow, but ensured I had time to read up on the patterns while inmplementing this.

Used vite/react-ts template to get up and running sharpish. Had a look at the react-redux one but it had a lot more to strip out so started with a nice clean vite one.

File naming convention is a bit ugly, I tried not to get too bogged down in the detail and keep working.

Not sure how you guys like styles in react. I like the modules, but find dynamic styles a bit ugly without a library like classnames. I would normally use sass on a standalone project where I decide on setup as I like the syntax particularly when following a BEM pattern, but again, simple app so didn't worry about making it perfect for me.
